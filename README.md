```
npm install
```

2. Run the server (default port 3000)

```
npm run start
# or for auto-reload during development
npm run dev

### GET /benchmarks

Returns aggregated benchmark statistics (e.g., count, average score, percentiles) computed from stored scoring records.

### GET /benchmarks/{country}

Returns benchmark statistics for the specified country code (e.g., `mx`, `pe`, `co`, `cl`, `ar`, `us`).

### GET /records

Lists recent anonymized scoring records (derived from POST `/credit-score`).

Query parameters:

- `limit`: number (default 50, max 200)
- `offset`: number (default 0)

### GET /records/{country}

Same as `/records` but filtered by country code.

Query parameters:

- `limit`: number (default 50, max 200)
- `offset`: number (default 0)

## Data storage

Benchmarks are calculated from user-submitted scoring records stored in a newline-delimited JSON file.

- Default path: `data/records.jsonl`

## Environment variables

- `PORT`: server port (default 3000)

## Validation

- Input is validated with Zod.
- Required fields: `age`, `monthly_income`, `payment_history`, `active_debts`, `current_job_tenure_months`.
- `payment_history` accepted values: `excellent`, `good`, `fair`, `poor`.

## Scoring model (transparent)

- Base score 650 with adjustments for age, income, payment history, active debts, job tenure, and collateral.
- Final score is clamped to 300â€“850.
- Default probability is a smooth function of the score.
- Risk levels: `very_low`, `low`, `medium`, `elevated`, `high`.
